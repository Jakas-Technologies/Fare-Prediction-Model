# Fare-Prediction-Model
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model for determining angkot fares based on historical data. Developed by the JAKAS ML team, this model aims to provide accurate and efficient fare predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset created specifically for training and evaluating the Angkot Fare Prediction Model. It consists of the following:

- **Features**:
  1. **Distance**: The distance of the angkot journey, measured in meters.
  2. **Passenger Type**: The type of passenger, categorized as Student, General, or Elderly.

- **Label**:
  - Fare: The target variable representing the angkot fare.

The simulated dataset is included in the `dataset/` directory, and you can explore it further for insights into the data.
